IDEAS ABOUT THE WEBSITE
The website of gramiksha is not responsive,using bootstrap will help.
On clicking gallary a all new website opens and it looks like a new website.
the pages are too long and thus can be made shorter.
The footer content could be shortened. 


IDEAS ABOUT THE WEBPAGE
I have basically used the page of GRAMISKHA and tried to give it a new look.
I have tried adding carausal and responsive images to navigate to other pages.
I have not yet given my attention towards css and color combination.
